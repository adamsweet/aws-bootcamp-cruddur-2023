# Week 4 â€” Postgres and RDS
* Followed all mandatory videos.
* Created Postgres database on RDS and able to connect from Gitpod environment.
* Created environment variables and bash scripts for basic DB actions/connectivity
* Created Lambda function to insert Cognito user into Postgres DB (setting up security policy for that got pretty deep).
* Able to create new activities via JS frontend and see them in DB.
* Got stuck on "ERROR: null value in column "user_uuid" of relation "activities" violates not-null constraint" for a while but [this](https://discord.com/channels/1055552619441049660/1086233246691495968) saved me.
* Struggled with time availability this week due to catching up from last week and volume of video material for RDS/Postgres.
* Likely to fall further behind over next 2 weeks due to work and personal commitments and volume of video material for week 5 but will catch up in subsequent weeks and complete bootcamp.
